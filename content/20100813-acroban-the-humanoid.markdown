title: Acroban the Humanoid
author: Ian Macinnes

<p>This is an interesting robot from <a title="Inria Flowers home page" href="http://flowers.inria.fr/index.php" target="_blank">Inria Flowers</a>
that was showcased at the ACM SIGGRAPH Conference that's just finished. The robot has a fixed rather than random morphology but it is a
very nice example of a real physical robot with two legs and a torso being able to balance in the face of perturbations.</p>

<p>Although it can balance itself in the face of minor knocks and shakes, it doesn't walk like a human. A walking human
keeps moving their centre of gravity forward so one foot has to be placed ahead to stop the body falling. In fact, human walking
has been described as controlled falling. Acroban appears to be careful to keep its centre of gravity above support points (i.e. its feet)
so it won't tip over. This is why is moves so slowly. Still a very nice robot though! Anything that tall that's constantly
moving that can balance itself is a tremendous achievement.</p>
