title: A robot with evolved morphology and controller
author: Ian Macinnes

<p>My doctorate back in 2006 was partly research on evolving the morphologies of
robots and controllers in simulation and then constructing them. Most of the robots
are now lost but today I discovered these movies of a single example.</p>

<p>The fitness function of the population of robots was simply to move.
The population size was 30. The robot uses a continuous time recurrent neural network as a controller, co-evolved
with the morphology over 1000 generations. This was the fittest agent from the final generation:</p>

<p>This is the agent after it was physically constructed:</p>

<p>An interesting aspect is the curved arms that were evolved to allow the robot to
roll over, then roll back.</p>
