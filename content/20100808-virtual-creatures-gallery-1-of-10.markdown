title: Virtual creatures gallery 1 of 10
author: Ian Macinnes

<p>I'm collecting videos of animats whose morphology and controllers have been evolved in order to improve my own video (and animat)
making ability. I'm looking for good visual designs and agents that <em>move</em> naturally, even though they may not have a very lifelike
body shape. I'll start with the granddaddy of them all - virtual creatures created by
<a title="Karls Sims' home page" href="http://www.karlsims.com/" target="_blank">Karl Sims</a>.</p>

<p>These were the first virtual creatures developed, way back in 1994 and I suspect still the most visually striking. They use a simple
<a title="PDF of technical paper &quot;Evolving Virtual Creatures&quot;" href="http://www.karlsims.com/papers/siggraph94.pdf" target="_blank">
developmental algorithm for the morphology and a unique controller</a>, a hybrid of neural network and various functions to generate different
activation patterns that are used to control the body.</p>

<p>He also evolved creatures to <a title="PDF of technical paper &quot;Evolving 3D Morphology and Behavior by Competition&quot;"
href="http://www.karlsims.com/papers/alife94.pdf" target="_blank">compete against each other</a>. The agents do not have much in the way of
sensors and so this was really a different evolutionary pressure for movement rather than coordinating perceptual and action.</p>
