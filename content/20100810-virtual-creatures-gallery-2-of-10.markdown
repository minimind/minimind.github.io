title: Virtual creatures gallery 2 of 10
author: Ian Macinnes

<p>This is another post in an occasional series of other peoples&' videos</a> of evolved virtual creatures. I like these evolved
creatures by the <a title="Evolution of Robotic Organisms home page" href="http://ero.matfyz.cz/" target="_blank">ERO</a> group
(Evolution of Robotic Organisms). The swimming agents especially are wonderful!</p>

<p>The methodology is kept very close to that of Sims (e.g. same transfer functions such as abs, atan, cos, sigmoid, etc.) but
the most recent work applies the
<a title="PDF of technical paper &quot;Towards Efficient Evolutionary Design of Autonomous Robots&quot;"
href="http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krcap1am/ero/doc/krcah49.pdf" target="_blank">NEAT crossover operator</a> that allows
speciation within a population.</p>
